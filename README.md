# Kernel-test-isos-and-source-code
First isos for the kernel projects and source code at 4/22/22
Thist is my first project in github not entirely sure on how the file system works however I am learning the latest release will be in up to date source code
previous versions will be in the test isos file with no source code as not major changes have been made yet and feature will only be added going on from this point
